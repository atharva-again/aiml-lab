# Learnings
- The original BFS implementation correctly marked nodes as visited when adding to the queue, which is the standard way to avoid duplicates in the queue.
- The DFS implementation used a recursive approach which is standard.
- Adding `time.sleep` and `clear_screen` significantly improves the educational value of the script.

# Changes
- Modified `0901AI231019_File1.py` to be interactive.
- Added `clear_screen` and `wait_for_user` helper functions.
- Modified `bfs` and `dfs` to include animation delays and detailed logging.
- Implemented a main menu loop to allow repeated execution and configuration.
